# Family tree visualizer

@author: Bence Pipis, 2021

This repo contains my project that aims to enable users to visualize their family tree if their ancestors are in the database. The database contains people who were born in and near Tótkomlós, Hungary in the last three centuries, meaning roughly 70k individual. 
The app runs in Microsoft PowerShell after unblocking the .ps1 file and clicking on it or simply going to the directory in PowerShell where tree.py is located and execute python tree.py command. The usage from there is straightforward.
